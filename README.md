# 🐶🐱 Dogs vs Cats Classification

A deep learning project that classifies images as **Dog** or **Cat** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
It includes a Jupyter Notebook for model training and a Streamlit web app for live predictions.

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how to train and deploy an image classification model that can tell whether an image shows a **dog** or a **cat**.  
The notebook covers data preparation, model training, and performance evaluation, while the Streamlit app lets users test the model easily online.

## 💻 Streamlit App

The web app is built with **Streamlit** and uses the CNN model trained in the notebook.  
It allows you to:

- Upload an image or paste a direct image URL  
- Instantly get a prediction → **Dog 🐶 or Cat 🐱**  
- View the model’s confidence score  
- Enjoy a clean, minimal interface
